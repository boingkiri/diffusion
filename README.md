# Diffusion implementation

This repository is for practicing implementation of diffusion model with JAX family framework. The code is worked in environment of TPU v3-8.

# How to use
You can manipulate the overall hyperparameter in `conig.yml` file.

If you want to train the model, `training.sh` will take care of all of the training processing. Or, if you want to do sampling with trained model, `sampling.sh` will be your choice.
